# Workday Scheduler Challenge-05
## Description
This assignment's task was to create a work day planner that the user could save information in and return to, with styling that dynamically updates as the day goes on.  The time blocks on the page change color through the day to reflect their state of past, present, or future.

To do this, I used JQuery, Bootstrap, DayJS, localStorage. My motivations were to rely on the API's documentation to give my app function, use the psuedocode to guide me as much as possible, and to strengthen my understand of JavaScript logic and interaction in web development. I was happy to use it for something more practical, and was able to achieve desired functionality.

In addition to the planner's requirements, I also updated the styling to be more my taste. I did this by removing and adding some CSS, and I also practiced using Bootstrap utilities in my HTML to position the header.
## Usage
To use this planner, you can write in anything from tasks, reminders, or a even just a note to yourself in the text field next to the desired time and click the orange button to the side to save it for a later visit. The colors will dynamically update through the day to show the passage of time.
